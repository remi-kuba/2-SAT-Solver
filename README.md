# 2-SAT-Solver

This SAT solver works for 2-CNF problems, which are boolean formulas that are in the form (x_0 OR x_1) AND (x_2 OR x_3) AND . . . AND (x_n or x_{n+1}). Note: variables in 2-CNF formulas are allowed to take a NOT in front of them. <br />
Also included at the bottom of the program is an example use of a 2-SAT-Solver: solving a sudoku board. This approach is not the optimal approach to solving a sudoku board (recursive backtracking is still much faster), but you can still turn an unsolved board into boolean format. <br />
